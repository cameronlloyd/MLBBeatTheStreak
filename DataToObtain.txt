For each game played in the season, we want to get the starting lineup. From there, we get data from
both of the starting pitchers. All of the data we want is career Hits/Plate Appearances. For pitchers,
we want to get their handedness for pitching, how well they do when home versus away, and how well they
perform against a right handed batter and a left handed batter. Then we go to each starting batter and
get their handedness, how well they do when home versus away, and how well they perform against the 
pitcher's handedness. In the end, for a single game we should have 18 total rows of data. Each row
will look like:

Row = [dateOfGame, batterName, batterVsPitcherHand, batterLocation, pitcherVsBatterHand, pitcherLocation, hit]
where:
batterVsPitcherHand, batterLocation, pitcherVsBatterHand, pitcherLocation are all Hits/Plate Appearances.
hit is either 0 or 1, depending on if that certain player got a hit on that date

We should also obtain the number of At Bat Appearances for batters. We could possibly exclude
individuals with low sample sizes in order to avoid outliers.

{DateOfGame, Batter Name, Pitcher Name, vRHP, At Home, vLHB, Away, Hit on this day, At bats at game}
	-	Date of game played
	-	Batters name (either home or away)
	-	Pitchers name (opposite of batters team (i.e if batter home, pitcher away))
	-	(hits/AB) of batter v hand of pitcher
	-	(hits/AB) of batter when either home or away
	-	(hits/AB) of pitcher v hand of batter
	-	(hits/AB) of pitcher when either home or away
	-	If batter got hit in current game (Either 1 or 0)
	-	How many at bats batter had 


### NOTE: if batter handedness if both, takes average of RHP and LHP performance, and vice-versa
